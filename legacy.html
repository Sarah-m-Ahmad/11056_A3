    <h2>Influence and Contemporaries</h2>
    <p>Andrews was part of a dynamic generation of Australian designers who sought to modernise the country's design identity. His contemporaries included Grant Featherston, known for his innovative furniture designs, and Douglas Annand, a celebrated graphic designer. Together, these designers helped to shape the visual language of mid-century Australia, bringing international influences into a uniquely Australian context.</p>
    <p>His work also intersected with the broader architectural and design movements of his time. He collaborated with architects and urban planners, contributing to projects that reflected the increasing modernisation of Australian cities. Andrews was deeply involved in discussions about national identity in design, advocating for an approach that balanced global trends with distinctly Australian elements.</p>
