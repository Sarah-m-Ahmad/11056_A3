            <p>Gordon Andrews (1914â€“2001) was an influential Australian designer whose work spanned multiple disciplines, including industrial design, graphic design, and exhibition design. 
                Born in Sydney, Andrews initially trained as an artist before transitioning into design, where he became a pivotal figure in shaping modern Australian visual culture. His career began in the 1930s, and by the post-war period, he had established himself as a leading designer, working on projects both domestically and internationally.
